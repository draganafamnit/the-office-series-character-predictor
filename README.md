- `train.py` - Main training script

## How to Run
Clone the repo, install requirements and run scripts
```bash
git clone https://github.com/draganafamnit/the-office-series-character-predictor.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python preprocess.py
python train.py
```
## About
The project was implemented in both Google Colab and VS Code due to local environment constraints. Multiple GitHub and syncing issues were encountered and solved manually. This workflow and setup will be described in detail in the final project report.
